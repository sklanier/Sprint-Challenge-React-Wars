1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

ReactJS is a front-end framework designed to facilitate the creation of dynamic single-page applications through the use of a proprietary virtual document-object model.

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

To "think" in react, I assume, is to approach a problem not as a top-to-bottom HTML document, but as a spatial, organic application that is dependant on the declaration of its view states.

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

Class/Stateful components are ES6 classes. Functional components are, quite literally, functions. Functional components are generally better to work with, as they are easier to read, write, and debug.

1.  Describe state.

A state is how the viewport looks at a given point in the application's lifecycle. States are dynamic, and need to be defined by JS functions in order to render properly.

1.  Describe props.

"Props", or "properties", are literal variable representatives of data properties. They are static and do not change, and are used to link states within an application's lifecycle.
